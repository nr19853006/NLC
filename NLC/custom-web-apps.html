                                <p>First, let's talk about what a web app is not. For starters, web apps are not the same as mobile apps, and they are different from other website features such as blogs, events, and news. Custom web apps are complex, "out of the box" are not available, and are designed to capture the process, and to store data. The shopping cart and login form are two examples of web applications, and these two features are beginning with reference to the possibilities.</p>

                    <p>When we develop custom web applications, a "one size does not fit all". There are two things that are similar to all our custom web apps, though: they are incredibly user-friendly and can be customized to fit your exact needs. Your unique application will be built inside an easy to use CMS (content management system), which will allow a stress-free experience for you and any member of your team. Apart from this, the possibilities are essentially endless, no matter how complex your needs are. Often, there are applications that seem incredibly complex, but you need to make them a reality which is an experienced team of development experts. If you want to know more about the NLC development process and how you can generate more conversions with web applications.</p>

                    1.	Planning & Specification
                        We will stop the development process by listening and learning about your vision for your website's custom application. Together, we will talk about what you want Our development team will make a specification document after listening and researching which describes the parameters of the project.
                        <br /><br />
                    2.	Feature Plan Finalization
                        Our next step is about client interaction and approval. NLC will develop a comprehensive project plan, which is made from the specification document. We want your web app to function exactly as you imagined, so before you start you have to review and approve everything. The final costs are also calculated at this point, and thanks to the complete plan stage, there will be no surprise at all!
                        <br /><br />
                    3.	Web App Development
                        Now, the time has come for our team to run their magic. When we take care of coding, then sit back and relax.
                        <br /><br />
                    4.	Quality Assurance
                        A fully quality assurance (QA) and review are an essential part of the development process, and we never cut corners on this important step. Our team will test the web app in different devices, browsers and in various situations so that you can be assured that your custom app will make your work unbearable.
                        <br /><br />
                    5.	Going Live
                        Get excited, because your custom web app is ready to go live! Web applications can be distributed in two ways: as part of a completely new website or applied to an existing site.
